    <h2>I am from Logan, Utah and I'm currently in my Sophomore year and I'm majoring in Computer Information Systems!
     Some of my hobby's include camping, hiking and watching football. I'm a big fan of the Packers and I don't have a college team that I follow.
      I also love sea food and trying foods that I've never had. Some skills and talents that I have are shooting and speaking Spanish. 
      Some things that I hope to do in my lifetime are to visit Europe and to travel to every state in the United States I've been to 12 states.</h2>
